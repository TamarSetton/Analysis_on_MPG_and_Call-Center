Given 2 dataframes, I was told to analyze them in R. for mpg, I was given detailed instructions. As for the call center dataframe, I was told breifly inspect it and see what I come up with. 
The file "Tableau of ITDS.pdf" has the begining steps, and the Tableau analysis I did on mpg. The url for the Tableau page is on a "url for Tableau". The "ITDS Fianl mpg" and "ITDS Fianl call center" comtain the code and comments of my data analysis.
